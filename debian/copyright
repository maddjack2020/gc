 compiler options (GCC) to use are:

 A really simple-minded text editor based on cords.
 Things it does right:
 No size bounds.
 Unbounded undo.
 Shouldn't crash no matter what file you invoke it on (e.g. /vmunix)
 (Make sure /vmunix is not writable before you try this.)
 Scrolls horizontally.
 Things it does wrong:
 It doesn't handle tabs reasonably (use "expand" first).
 The command set is MUCH too small.
 The redisplay algorithm doesn't let curses do the scrolling.
 The rule for moving the window over the file is suboptimal.

 An incomplete test for the garbage collector.
 Some more obscure entry points are not tested at all.
 This must be compiled with the same flags used to build the
 GC.  It uses GC internals to allow more precise results

 Some simple primitives for allocation with explicit type information.
 Facilities for dynamic type inference may be added later.
 Should be used only for extremely performance critical applications,
 or if conservative collector leakage is otherwise a problem (unlikely).
 Note that this is implemented completely separately from the rest
 of the collector, and is not linked in unless referenced.

 This is a simple API to implement pointer back tracing, i.e.
 to answer questions such as "who is pointing to this" or
 "why is this object being retained by the collector"
 .
 Most of these calls yield useful information on only after
 a garbage collection.  Usually the client will first force
 a full collection and then gather information, preferably
 before much intervening allocation.
 .
 The implementation of the interface is only about 99.9999%
 correct.  It is intended to be good enough for profiling,
 but is not intended to be used with production code.
 .
 Results are likely to be much more useful if all allocation is
 accomplished through the debugging allocators.
 .
 The implementation idea is due to A. Demers.

 This is mostly an internal header file.  Typical clients should
 not use it.  Clients that define their own object kinds with
 debugging allocators will probably want to include this, however.
 No attempt is made to keep the namespace clean.  This should not be
 included from header files that are frequently included by clients.

 A few files have other copyright holders. A few of the files needed
 to use the GNU-style build procedure come with a modified GPL license
 that appears not to significantly restrict use of the collector, though
 use of those files for a purpose other than building the collector may
 require the resulting code to be covered by the GPL.
 .
 For more details and the names of other contributors, see the README.md,
 doc/README.*, AUTHORS and include/gc.h files.  These files describe typical
 use of the collector on a machine that is already supported.

 This contains interfaces to the GC marker that are likely to be useful to
 clients that provide detailed heap layout information to the collector.
 This interface should not be used by normal C or C++ clients.
 It will be useful to runtimes for other languages.
 .
 This is an experts-only interface!  There are many ways to break the
 collector in subtle ways by using this functionality.

 This is a string packages that uses a tree-based representation.
 See cord.h for a description of the functions provided.  Ec.h describes
 "extensible cords", which are essentially output streams that write
 to a cord.  These allow for efficient construction of cords without
 requiring a bound on the size of a cord.
 .
 More details on the data structure can be found in

 A fundamentally similar "rope" data structure is also part of SGI's standard
 template library implementation, and its descendants, which include the
 GNU C++ library.  That uses reference counting by default.
 There is a short description of that data structure at
 http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/ropeimpl.html .
 .
 All of these are descendants of the "ropes" in Xerox Cedar.
 .
 cord/tests/de.c is a very dumb text editor that illustrates the use of cords.
 It maintains a list of file versions.  Each version is simply a
 cord representing the file contents.  Nonetheless, standard
 editing operations are efficient, even on very large files.
 (Its 3 line "user manual" can be obtained by invoking it without
 arguments.  Note that ^R^N and ^R^P move the cursor by
 almost a screen.  It does not understand tabs, which will show
 up as highlighted "I"s.  Use the UNIX "expand" program first.)
 To build the editor, type "make de" in the gc directory.

 Cords are immutable character strings.  A number of operations
 on long cords are much more efficient than their strings.h counterpart.
 In particular, concatenation takes constant time independent of the length
 of the arguments.  (Cords are represented as trees, with internal
 nodes representing concatenation and leaves consisting of either C
 strings or a functional description of the string.)
 .
 The following are reasonable applications of cords.  They would perform
 unacceptably if C strings were used:
 - A compiler that produces assembly language output by repeatedly
 concatenating instructions onto a cord representing the output file.
 - A text editor that converts the input file to a cord, and then
 performs editing operations by producing a new cord representing
 the file after each character change (and keeping the old ones in an
 edit history).
 .
 For optimal performance, cords should be built by
 concatenating short sections.
 This interface is designed for maximum compatibility with C strings.
